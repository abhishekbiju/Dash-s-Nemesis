# Dash-s-Nemesis
This project is a 2D single player battle royale combat game titled ‘DASH’S NEMESIS’ a couple of my friends and I coded from scratch in Python involving over 2000 lines of code and various mechanisms integrated into the game for a seamless, tailored and professional gameplay experience. The main aim of the game is to defeat the villain (RA-ONE) while you control the protagonist, DASH. The game is complete with graphically designed title and menu screens to keep it aesthetically appealing. The game is controlled using your keyboard with ‘WASD’ for movement and special keys for throwing punches and kicks. Besides these moves we worked hard to integrate 4 individual special power moves with dedicated sprite sheets for seamless animation. We also programmed in a live health bar and charge-up which decided how long you survive the game as well as when you’re permitted to use a power move. To bring it altogether we coded in an SQL integration so that the game tracks the highest scores and displays a leaderboard if you’re able to beat it!
